title: AEM 2016/2017 program and operation
description: Please join Thorsten to get familiar with AEM’s 2016/2017 program and operations framework we are working with. With the Mobile and Livefyre teams joining the family the need for an operations model that scales has become a critical factor to support AEM’s continuous growth. Thorsten will provide an overview on how AEM planning and execution these days is organized, talk about specific goals for this year to improve AEM’s operational efficiency and how it is applicable to AEM RnD. He will end the session giving an outlook where we are heading to next year and will save some time for questions.
