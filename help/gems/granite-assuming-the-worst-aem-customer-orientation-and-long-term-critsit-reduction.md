seo-title: Assuming the worst - AEM Customer orientation and long-term CritSit reduction
description: "Many customer escalations happen because they have been doing things "wrong", setup the wrong backup commands, did not read the documentation, have poor customization code that creates performance issues and so on. As a product engineer, it's easy to blame the customer for not doing the right thing. We do this very often, myself included. However, with the large number of customers and the complexity of AEM today, combined with the limited development resources customers have available, this mindset of expecting the "perfect" customer is hurting our bottom line: we have too much costly disruption through escalations. This talk will explain how we can all help improving the situation by designing and implementing the product in a way that limits how much someone can screw up and how the product can be operated well even with minimal knowledge."
