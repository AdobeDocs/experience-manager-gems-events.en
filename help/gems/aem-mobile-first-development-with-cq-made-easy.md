title: Mobile-First Development with CQ Made Easy
description: This talk presents patterns for responsive design in CQ and explains how to provide a media-rich HTML5 mobile experience that performs on low-bandwidth connections. To demonstrate these patterns, we will work through the transformation of a CQ site from desktop only to mobile-first. We'll dive into how mobile-first design principles were used, adaptive images and progressive enhancement to create it, and weâ€™ll discuss the pitfalls encountered along the way. The session is based on Bruce's talk during the CQ Conference in Basel, Switzerland (CQCON, 2013).
