# Integrate AEM & CIF framework to build a rich and immersive e-commerce experience

The Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce are seamlessly integrated using the Commerce Integration Framework (CIF). CIF enables AEM to directly access and communicate with the commerce instance using Adobe Commerce’s GraphQL APIs.
